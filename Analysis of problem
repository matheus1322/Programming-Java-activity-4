How are you going to solve the problem? 

First, when I identified the problem, I defined two arraylists, one for the candidates and the other for the votes. 
I defined a boolean variable for the loop to continue running the program every time it is true or exit when the user wants. 
In the loop, the code stores the candidate's name and the number of votes, adding them until the count is finished, or creating a new entry every time a new candidate is inserted. 
The result is looped through two lists that show the candidates and another that shows the number of votes, to finally show the winner and how many votes he had. 

What programming constructs and techniques are you using? Why? 

I chose to use the arraylist instead of the array because it allows me to store the candidates in an optimized and practical way, making my code cleaner and more efficient. 
I used a while loop to continue the code even when a candidate receives a vote or until the user wants to exit. I used the for loop to calculate the votes for each candidate and show the results. 
I also used the if.else to check the inputs used by the user, verify if each candidate exists and determine the number of votes for each one. I used the input scanner for the user to enter information. 
I used the try-catch to validate inputs and avoid errors or wrong inputs. I also used a string trim manipulation that removes the spaces around the inputs, helping to keep the format in which the candidates appear consistent. 
I also used a logical comparison to compare the votes and see who was the winner. Finally, the displayResultsAndWinner encapsulation was a logic used to determine the winner.
